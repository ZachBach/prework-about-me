      <p>I love working on computers in general, and now i want to learn how they work behind the scenes and make it
         into a career! In todays world of technology where everything we do on a day to day basis is run on code,using
          them and understadning how  they work is facsinating to me. That fascination is what's driving me to make it 
          into a career that i will enjoy doing what i love.
